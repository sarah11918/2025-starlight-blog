Write the docs you have, not how you got them.
:::

Life is a journey, not a destination. Your docs readers, however, are not along for the ride.

Just as [you don't need to narrate the progression through the page](/blog/50-12-cool-story-bro), you can also cut the "life story" of your docs.

One PR suggestion I often make is to **document your features, not how or why they came to be**. 

- ‚úÖ To add support for formatting `.astro` files, use the official Astro Prettier plugin.

- üòê To add Astro support (`.astro` files), we created and maintain an official Prettier Astro plugin.

When you remove the story of *what you did*, the focus naturally shifts to what your *reader should do*... which is what they really came to docs for in the first place!
