Use sequence words to help your reader progress through your instructions.
:::

This tip is inspired by [one of my favourite clips from the television show "Frasier"](https://youtu.be/Jtq1EBMe1gQ?si=ClhCYl0R2Efb0VVk&t=120) in which Frasier defends his difficulties in a night school class for basic car mechanic skills:

> So you twist.... *then* pull? You see, I was twisting and pulling simultaneously as per *your* instructions: 'Twist **and** pull.'

You could argue I am being "that guy" when I make a PR suggestion to **replace conjunctions with adverbs to more explicitly describe a sequence of actions**. You might not be wrong! But, have you taught students like Frasier? The best defence is a good offence!

Need your reader to do two things simultaneously? Consider using **while**, **as**, or **at the same time**. Try reserving "and" for your lists for the next little while. *Then*, judge for yourself whether this is a tip for you.

Additionally, I find that I tend to use "and" in the middle of a sentence more often than at the beginning. The reverse seems to be true when using "then." Reminding myself of "twist *then* pull" has the added benefit of subtly nudging me to start a new sentence where I might have otherwise just kept on going... and that is almost never a bad thing!
