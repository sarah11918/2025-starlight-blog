Group the most similar items together for a definition that flows.
:::

Docs writing is all about crafting concise, yet meaningful, definitions. It's not always easy! Sometimes, you have a few key ideas that you really want to get across to give your reader a great introduction to a term. Presenting your reader with the right amount of information to explain without being overwhelming is only part of the job. The individual parts also have to flow.


One type of PR suggestion I make is to **deconstruct your definition into its elements, then recombine them in the order that causes the least context switching.** I am often introducing a term that may have a format, a purpose, a structure, a main benefit, a notable caveat or constraint...  As a result, definitions are often information-dense, meant to be unpacked over the course of the section or page. You can help your reader successfully navigate a lot of thoughts expressed in not a lot of words by putting these separate pieces in a logical order.

Below, I suggest starting with the technical properties of the file (type and location) together, followed by implementation details of its contents. This allows someone looking for a straight definition to stop there and keeps them focused on the concept of a particular file in their project. Then, I suggest moving on to describing how powerful and useful it is.


- ‚úÖ "An API Route is a `.js` or `.ts` file within the `src/pages` folder that takes a Request and returns a Response. A powerful feature of SSR-enabled projects, API routes are able to securely execute code on the server side."

- üòê "API Routes is a powerful feature of SSR, represented by a `.js` or `.ts` file. They take a Request and return a Response while begin able to securely execute code on the server side. These should be located within the `src/pages` folder. 

This is not the only way to organize those ideas! If the purpose of a page is selling a feature, not defining it, then one might choose to start with how powerful and useful API routes can be.

No matter how you slice it, an introduction or definition runs the risk of throwing a lot of facts at a reader... right upfront! I consider it my responsibility to at least be throwing from the same direction as often as I can.
