Use the words you mean.
:::

The word with the most definitions in the Oxford English dictionary is "set." It has **430** different ways to use it! (And, it will apparently be [overtaken in the 2037 edition](https://www.businessinsider.com/words-with-the-most-definitions-2019-1#run-645-definitions-1) by "run" and its anticipated 645 meanings!)

Fortunately, "set" and "run" have pretty standard meanings in our context of documentation! The word that *can* "run" off the rails for us, though, is "use."

It's not that "use" has too many confusing definitions to be clearly understood. To "avail oneself of", "put into action", or "carry out a purpose or action by means of" aren't all that dissimilar. But, "use" often ends up obscuring or replacing that "purpose or action" and we lose the chance to express ourselves more precisely... perhaps more helpfully!  

One PR suggestion I often make is to **try to express exactly *how* or *in what way*, something is "used."** If someone handed you a hammer and said, "Use this!" you'd have a reasonable idea of what they meant. But, you can "use" the claw portion of a hammer to *remove* nails, too!

Upon seeing "use" at the beginning of an instruction, I imagine physically throwing a feature, tool, or option at my unsuspecting reader and shouting, "Use this!"

Can I be more helpful by giving them an explicit step to execute?

It's challenging not to use "use!" (Not to *write* "use"...?) But it's rewarding to dig deeper than my first instinct and find a more descriptive word that gives my reader just that little bit more guidance!
